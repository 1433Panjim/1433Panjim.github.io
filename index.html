            <h3>Random thoughts at 5am</h3>



            <p>
              Just to go on record, all these messages are written only after 5am. All the times, when I can‚Äôt sleep cause i‚Äôm thinking about you ü•∞. Babeu, i know covid has hit hard this whole month and I really can‚Äôt believe that i havent seen you in over 5 days??? Before this I was with you in Goa and before that we met almost everyday üò≠. I know it‚Äôs getting a lil taxing, but prolly have said this before and gonna say it again‚Ä¶ DARKEST BEFORE DAWN so leggoo. Maybe it‚Äôs a sign from God that we don‚Äôt meet until your interview, so you can crack it and be with me in New Yorkü§çü§ç.
  When making this whole thing including the CTF, looking back on our previous relation, I know it wasnt the best and we dont have a single living memory of the things we did, other than 6/10 the bad ones. So this time around, didn‚Äôt wanna have a ghost relationship where i get blocked and deleted, so here‚Äôs a lil something that stays. Plus everyone needs a hobby, so here goes another bi-product of dating me.
  Time to continue this cause I‚Äôm seeeeing you again kal and super excited to finally show you this. Definitely, kept this away from you for the longest time and it was sooooo hard to not give it away, but finally tomorrow‚Äôs the day. love every inch of you ü§ç

<b>day 3 log 1(jan 12th, 2022/5:17pm):</b> gotta keep this log short cause i‚Äôm working on my edit and CFA. as far as the status update goes, woke up by your call while i was anyway dreaming about you. it was like inception all over again. hopefully you‚Äôre having a gooood and not so tiring day at office. as promised, you‚Äôre gonna get tested tonight/kal and be negative, reiterating on the fact that you have to get tested tonight/kal, so you get primed. love you. almost half way done with the quarantine phase. so gotta hold your horses for a lil bit longer, until i come 2 √ú. love youü§ç<br>
<b>day 3 log 2(jan 13th, 2022/4:15am):</b>  today was a v v hopeful day specially cause you tested negative. i have never been happier, even when my report came neg, i was less happier and ecstatic than today. finally, i think this log has got just a day more to see before i come and see you. also, finally saw ‚ÄúDefinitely, Maybe üíï‚Äù w you and i would rather see this movie with no one else other than you. i remember it getting added and being on top on netflix like a year or two back, and from that day till today, i‚Äôve waited to see the movie w you at the right time. and no better time to see it other than today cause i finally get confirmation of a) you‚Äôre not dying b) i‚Äôm seeing you after a week of being locked up. once again, if i haven‚Äôt said it enough, i love you and hopefully goodbyes get less harder. be it in person or on call, it‚Äôs equally hard to see you go irrespective of the amount of time we‚Äôve been together. love every atom and molecule of you ü§ç</p>

I dont wanna send this to you right now and jinx meeting you but FUCK i‚Äôm soooo excited. last year on 13th jan, i met you for the first time 1-on-1 after a solid 4.5 years for the drive to pizza express and wellness and if i‚Äôm being so honest, that was the time things started to hit me. might sound fake, but that was the day i started thinking about you and wow haven‚Äôt stopped since, be it ‚Äòthrough thiccc and then‚Äô(ik its my caption). the very next day i was leaving for new york and just wanted to see you again when i called you for the kite flyinggg. hopefully safe to say, this time, you actually have a chance to come back with me and i cant just fucking wait for you to get accepted and have the time of your life in new york(hopefully x2 with me). anyway wanted to make you a list of things to go to/eat. shall attach a link soon. offo it‚Äôs almost 6am and i‚Äôm penning my thoughts here and making the whole website for 27th ü§çü•∞. fuck, idk, i can't think of places we wanna eat at this time of the hour... will ask you another string of unrealted questions to extort this information. can‚Äôt wait to SEE you tomorrow and go to my fav restaurant w my fav person. thank you sooooo much for this, love you to pieces. ü§ç</p>

                    <p> Hi baby, won‚Äôt be with you on the 27th :( felt this should go live then. Finally the countdown comes to an end and this is a by-product of all the sitting I did üòö
While making this, it turns out that I remember every little thing that we have done together and honestly nothing feels better. Everything feels right and in place when I‚Äôm with you and even when I‚Äôm not. Just talking to you on a phone call makes me feel better and just no matter how zoned out I get at times, just talking to you makes it all okay. Noone else even comes close when it comes to making me feel this happy. I genuinely have arrived in life and i‚Äôm glad I know this at 24. (Lol, typing that made me realize I'm not that ‚Äòsmall‚Äô anymore).
I‚Äôm so glad we had that conversation in Alibag that night and i just want to confess smth which i already did(i think). At times when I know I'm all in with you and so are you, I just get a very innate sense of a fear that if I lose you, I'll lose the best thing that has happened to me by far. Every time we fight or argue, I just HATE it and I'm genuinely actively trying my best to not cause any stress in our lives, but as long as this confession goes, I do get scared at times which gets me thinking and zoned out. Apart from mom‚Äôs health being meh at times and the fear of losing my love, I am the happiest in my life right now and I don‚Äôt want anything more. What I want for me is exactly what I want for you, and this is something which I haven‚Äôt wished for anyone. I want us to do exceedingly well in our career, academics and just life in general. When you‚Äôre in NYU, even if we don‚Äôt talk or get busy, I just want you to know that I‚Äôm always wishing the best for you and always will be here for you. I‚Äôm never walking out on us or on you and that‚Äôs a promise I'm making not just to you but to myself as well. I don‚Äôt see any other future with anyone else, I love you babe ü§ç

                    <p> okay here goes. not writing this to prove a point, but because this was long due and incoming. since the past 2 months i‚Äôve been holding onto the bangkok blog because it was unnecessarily sent(y)i. I deleted it cause i didnt wanna show it you but (lol I had a copy) and now maybe is the right time to tell you. Updating this on 1433, let‚Äôs see when you actually see it hahahah ly.  üòö<br><br>


<b>Jodhpur‚Üí</b><br>
<b>Vol I:</b> As soon as I dropped you at your A2 compartment for your Jodhpur wedding trip, the walk to the car and the drive back was soo ughhhh. Btw, that‚Äôs when i decided i‚Äôm making the kesariya video.<br>
<b>Vol II: </b>You sent the photos from haldi and the marriage and oh my god, my day is already better. Today I‚Äôm studying Equity Investments, and the only thing I can think of is b‚Äôlore and MF‚Äôs and ET‚Äôs on you. Hope this day gets over fkn quickk, cause my levels of going crazy are on the rise.<br>
<b>Vol III: </b>Okay you‚Äôre backkkk tommm finally. Thank you for getting me ghevarrrr, cause i know you will get it toh pehle hi bol deta hu. I can‚Äôt wait to come and pick you upppp from the airport and kiss you non stopppp(moderately long). Can‚Äôt waste too much time writing these, cause gotta study. Okkk see you tom lysm ü§ç<br><br>


<b>Bangkok</b><br>
<b>Day 1:</b> It‚Äôs only been a day since you‚Äôve gone and it feels like a year. I just hope you feel better and want you to have a nice and fun trip on this much deserved break.
I thought I‚Äôll write logs everyday, but sorry, FATT rahi hai, so I'll just study and write later.<br>
PS: making mental notes<br><br>
<b>Day 5:</b>With CFA being on my head this week along with you not being here, I was really all over the place. Plus the exam getting preponed by a day didn't make it any better and all I wanted to do was talk to you when I read the email.
<br>Okay so I know i might have been v selfish when it comes to that bangkok trip in terms of me wanting to talk to you whenever and wherever I wanted and getting pissed/moody cause maybe you were with people who I wish I could be, in terms of proximity to you. When i saw the same people around you 24x7, be it in b‚Äôlore where you stay with them from the time you wake up till the time you sleep or in office in gurgaon or even on office calls(even when im taking office calls on you), it made me just get very uptight yaar. The only reason why I dont wanna show you this blog is cause I dont want you to think any lesser of me, if I feel like this. I‚Äôm sure once you‚Äôre back home(which is in the next 7 or 8 hours and we meet hopefully), I‚Äôll be fine and it‚Äôs just me being retarted in this moment. I know you are busy with this trip and with people and ALL I WANT you to know is that never ever will I come in the way of your friends or what you want. Distance might be a little gray area when it comes to our fights, but I promise i wanna make this gray just B&W.
<br>I realized one famous person said and I quote, ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre in NYU, even if we don‚Äôt talk or get busy, I just want you to know that I‚Äôm always wishing the best for you and always will be here for you‚Äù. With this statement being said, I understand here on in NY, there will be some days or weeks where you will be busy and we won‚Äôt be able to get to each other(priming you for my bad network in Kashmir) ((nvm, you are already primed with shit network at my place))
I really dont want distance to come in the way of us and I really hope we make it happen.<br><br>
<b>Midterm over dayyyyyy:</b> I mean if we just scroll up in 1433 and take a trip down ML,
From the time you started applying and we sending each other voice notes(and me secretly wishing we work out and I express my feelings ASAP if u decide to come to US(and pick u up from the airport)), to the times where we were praying for your stern interview to go well, to the night I came driving to you after you got your admit(not to mention, i didnt drive to you on the HEC admission day ohhhh imm soooo sorrrryyy), to the times you checked interview slots every 5 min thanks to telegram bots, till the time you booked your flights to the TIME WE BOOKED LAUV TIX (and BRHAMASTRA TIX SOON). This has been a long journey of many many ups and some downs, but i dont want this journey to ever end. I dont know if this journey has a destination at the end or not(maybe it does), but yeh journey nahi khatam karni hai mujhe. So mudi, i dont know how to tell you but I want you to stay around and stick w me forever and forever. I love you (have before as well) and will continue to do so
You‚Äôre my whole heart and more üíçü§ç

      when i landed in india back in November of 20, i kinda expected this to be a trip cause office was remote and i‚Äôll visit friends and fam for a bit and fuck right back to New York.
      little did i know and in no time this so called ‚Äòtrip‚Äô became what i wanted from life.<br>
      be it in terms of a job, academics, love, family, just everything!  sure, US might be better with lifestyle and pay, but honestly what i‚Äôve realized is, nothing matters more than the happiness of doing things with you and falling in love every single day over and over again.<br>
      these 8/9 months with you, i have cherished every moment and only learnt how to be better not only as a boyfriend, but also, as a person. thanks for bringing out the best in me at all times and giving me a ray of hope even at my lowest. <br>
      now that both of us have advanced onto the next phase of academics(sounds like my linkedin post), i can‚Äôt be happier that you‚Äôre in the same country as me! i would honestly be shattered, if you didn‚Äôt come to US. maybe it is what is destined or just luck perhaps. all i care, is that it actually came through and what seemed like a far fetched dream for me and you has actually come true and nothing gets me more happy ü§ç<br>
      i hate saying goodbye to you, love. be it the first month of us together with us in the car with 1 hour loop of fallin all in you(when you said you‚Äôll leave after the song), or even now, at the airport! honestly i don‚Äôt know how i would react, if you weren‚Äôt coming to new york baby and i don‚Äôt even want to think how it would be. <br>
      looking super forward to seeing you here ASAP and wtf there‚Äôs suck sesh on the flight TV???? <br>
      I love you more than most of the things in my life and I plan to keep it this way for the foreseeable future. <br>
      Bye koü§çü§ç

      Hi baby, just another time when i‚Äôm missing the f out of you. HT cutesu üòö üòö  <br>
      This is perhaps the 2nd 27th, when we havent been together :( <br>
      Honestly not a fan of dates and monthly anniversaries(seems i‚Äôve grown a lil out of it), but you just feel home, mudi. Talking to you after a long day, just gets me going for the next. Now that college has kicked in and our schedules are somewhat packed, I especially want to point out the fact that, i know we might not have enough time in the day to talk to each other, but even that 1 call at night, be it for 10 min or 1 hour,  or the 5 min calls and facetimes in the middle of the day is really what keeps me up.
      Also, I know you are not feeling the best today my love and I know it sucks to be far from home :( In these times, you have to take care of yourself, not only when youre sick but even uske alaawa also. Don‚Äôt skip lunch and substitute them with applesssss and all (anyway im getting you a tiffin box to keep food warmm for lunch) (maybe). Not to sound like a mom, but babeu you only have to take care of you. <br>
      Anyway, i hope you feel better tomorrow my love and keep having warm water and garglinggg. Looking forward to every morning when you call me before going to class and every evening when you come back for the next 1.5 years ( minus the dec and summer breaks when we‚Äôre in a hmmm hm relationship) OHHKKKCAN DO <br>
      Have made so many memories with you baby, good, not so good and everyday i make more which i dont think ill be able to forget for the rest of my life. So, once again, youre the only person who gets me out of bad moods and the only person in my life who i love and i plan on loving for the rest of it. I love you with all i got  ü§ç
